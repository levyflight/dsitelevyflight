**One of my favourite song of Mohammed Rafi:**


 {{< youtube id="BeYuiywYK1M"  >}}

<br>
<br>
**English translation from [here](http://www.ardhamy.com/song/tu-hindu-banega)**

you'll neither be Hindu nor Muslim,

you're the son of human, you'll become a human,

Good that ’til now you have no name

You have no dealing with any religion

The knowledge which has divided humans

That knowledge will not burden you

You will be the face of the changing times

You are the child of a human; you’ll become a human

you'll neither be Hindu nor Muslim,

you're the son of human, you'll become a human,

The religion that teaches hatred is not yours

The step/foot that tramples humanity is not yours

The temple without a Qur’an is not your temple

The mosque without a Gita is not your mosque

You will become hope for peace and reconciliation

You are the child of a human; you’ll become a human

you'll neither be Hindu nor Muslim,

you're the son of human, you'll become a human,

These traders of religion; these who sell the country

These who sell the shroud off of corpses

These murderers and thieves sitting in palaces

These who sell thorns instead of flowers

You will become their death knell

You are the child of a human; you’ll become a human
